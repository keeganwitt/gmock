#summary How to user Gmock with Grails
#labels Featured

Download the jar file of Gmock from the [http://code.google.com/p/gmock/downloads/list download list], and drop it in the *lib* directory of your grails project. That's it. Then you can start writing your unit tests with Gmock.

Since Grails 1.2, a [http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/single.html#3.7%20Dependency%20Resolution dependency resolution] mechanism is introduced. You can simply specify the dependency of Gmock in the *grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy* file of your grails project as below:

{{{
grails.project.dependency.resolution = {
    ...
    repositories {        
        grailsPlugins()
        grailsHome()
        mavenCentral() // Gmock is in the Maven Central Repository
    }
    dependencies {
        test 'org.gmock:gmock:0.8.0'
        test 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-library:1.1' // Optionally, you can use hamcrest matchers
        ...
    }
}
}}}
