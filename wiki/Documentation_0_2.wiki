{{{
import org.gmock.GMockTestCase

class LoaderTest extends GMockTestCase {
    void testLoader(){
        def mockLoader = mock()
        mockLoader.load('key').returns('value')
        play {
            assertEquals "value", mockLoader.load('key')
        }
    }
}  
}}}

  * First extends the `GMockTestCase`
  * Create mock object using the `mock()` method
  * Setup expectation by calling the method you expect on your mock
  * Run the code you are testing within the `play` closure
